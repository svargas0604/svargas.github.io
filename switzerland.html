                    <p>The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291 as a defensive alliance among three cantons. In succeeding years, other localities joined the original three. The Swiss Confederation secured its independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499. </p>
                    <p>A constitution of 1848, subsequently modified in 1874 to allow voters to introduce referenda on proposed laws, replaced the confederation with a centralized federal government. Switzerland's sovereignty and neutrality have long been honored by the major European powers, and the country was not involved in either of the two World Wars. </p>
                    <p>The political and economic integration of Europe over the past half century, as well as Switzerland's role in many <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> and international organizations, has strengthened Switzerland's ties with its neighbors. However, the country did not officially become a <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> member until 2002. Switzerland remains active in many UN and international organizations but retains a strong commitment to neutrality.</p>
