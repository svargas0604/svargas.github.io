    <h1>Samantha Vargas</h1>
        <p>Hello! Welcome to my page. Wonderful to see you here. Scroll on to learn a bit more about me.</p>

    <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I was born on <time datetime="2001-06-04">June 4th, 2001</time> in Miami, FL. I've lived in Miami my whole life and I have a love-hate relationship with it. I'm currently studying journalism at the University of Miami.</p>

        <p>Another very important fact about me is I have three cats. I love them to death. I will never understand why cats get so much hate.</p>

    <h2>Aspirations</h2>
        
        <p>I graduate this semester, which means my career aspirations are starting to become too real. My main goal is to be able to write for an art or music magazine. I just love writing about art and artists. It gives me a lot of joy to write profiles about creatives or share cool things people are working on.</p>

        <p>I also hope to eventually get out of Miami.</p>

   <h2>Music Taste</h2>
        <p>I've been a <strong>HUGE</strong> music fan my entire life. My mom started me off with artists like Morrissey, Peter Murphy, and The Cure. She was very displeased when it turned out I'm a sucker for pop. I tortured her with One Direction in middle school.</p>
        <p>I spend a lot of time listening to music. In all honesty, I don't really stray away from my favorite artists too much. I think the familiarity is just really comforting.</p>

    <h3>Favorite Musical Artists</h3>
    <p>Some of my favorite artists (in no particular order) are:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Harry Styles</li>
         <li>Mitski</li>
         <li>Big Thief</li>
         <li>Phoebe Bridgers</li>
         <li>Lomelda</li>
         </ul>

    <h3>Favorite Albums</h3>
    <p>There's a lot of albums that I gravitate towards and can listen to on repeat. Here's a table of these albums along with their best tracks.</p>
